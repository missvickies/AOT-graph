An interactive graph to visualize social networks within the characters in the show "Attack on Titan". 

This project serves as a simple visualization to complement an assignment in our social networks class. 
The primary aim is to illustrate relationship fluctuations across seasons and make predictions about these changes. 
We achieve this by constructing a network with nodes representing characters and edges indicating their positive or negative relationships. Predictions are then made using triadic closure theory.
